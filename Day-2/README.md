# Day 2 - Basics to Create an eCommerce Website

Today, I learned about the frontend and backend needed to build a basic eCommerce website.

Frontend: This is what the user sees. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build pages like Home, Product, and Cart.

Backend: This handles the data and logic. Technologies like Node.js or PHP are used to manage products, user accounts, and orders.

This gave me a clear idea of how both parts work together in an eCommerce site.
