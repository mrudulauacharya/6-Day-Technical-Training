# Day 6 - Dev Connect & Student Management System

Today, I worked on two mini projects:

1. Dev Connect: A simple platform where developers can connect, share ideas, and collaborate. I learned how to display user profiles, posts, and use basic routing.

2. Student Management System: A basic app to add, update, and delete student records. This helped me understand how CRUD operations work in web applications.

Frontend: Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React if applied) to build the UI for both apps.

Backend (if used): Handled storing and managing data like student records or user profiles.

This gave me a good hands-on experience in building real-world projects with frontend and backend integration.
