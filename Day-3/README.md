# Day 3 - Continued Basics of eCommerce Website

Today, I continued from Day 2 and learned more about how the frontend and backend work together in an eCommerce website.

Frontend: I explored how to design product cards, navigation bars, and buttons using HTML and CSS. I also saw how JavaScript adds interactivity like adding items to a cart.

Backend: I learned how the backend connects to a database to store product details and user info. I also saw how it sends data to the frontend using APIs.

This helped me understand how user actions on the frontend (like clicking "Add to Cart") are handled in the backend.
