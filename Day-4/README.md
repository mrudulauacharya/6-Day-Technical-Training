# Day 4 - Created a Simple Chatbot

Today, I worked on building a basic chatbot.

I learned how a chatbot can take user input and respond with pre-defined answers. It was a rule-based chatbot using simple if-else logic.

Frontend: I created a chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where users can type messages and see bot replies.

Backend (if used): It handles user messages and returns responses. In some cases, it can connect with AI models or APIs.

This gave me a basic idea of how chatbot logic works and how to build a simple one.
