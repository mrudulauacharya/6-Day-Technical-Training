# Day 5 - Built an Interview App

Today, I worked on creating a basic Interview App.

The app allows users to practice interview questions and see sample answers. It includes a simple interface where questions appear one by one.

Frontend: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display questions, options, and answers. It also includes buttons to go to the next or previous question.

Backend (if used): Can store questions and user progress, and send data to the frontend through APIs.

This helped me understand how to build an interactive app and display dynamic content.
